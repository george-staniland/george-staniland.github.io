  <h4> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people </h4>
  <p> Understanding the neurological ways that our brains can change from learning and repetition encourages an abandonment of unhelpful self-beliefs. </p>

  <h4> Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit </h4>
  <p> 
    We could -<br>
    <br>
    Repeat a task we are trying to learn, and know that with each repetition the neural pathway associated with it is getting stronger<br>
    <br>
    Associate this new task with concepts and things we are familiar with<br>
    <br>
    Interact with it in a number of different ways and styles.

   <h4> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity </h4>
   <p> Get enough sleep, perform a task with your non-dominant hand, learn an instrument! </p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;color: blue;"> Researching Growth Mindset </h4>

<h4> Discuss what it is and why it is relevant </h4>
<p> Growth mindset is in part, the self-knowledge of what we discussed before, Neuroplasiticty.  When we know our brains can change and that
  our basic abilities and intelligence can be altered through practice, we approach mentally challenging situations more openly.<br>
  <br>
  When I couldn’t tackle a Javascript problem last week part of me labelled it as me failing, ‘I can’t do this’ , with a growth mindset we label this ’not yet!’, I am on a learning journey and I can not solve this problem.</p>

  <h4> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? </h4>
  <p>  I will continue to use this phrase of ’Not Yet!’ when facing a problem I’m struggling with. <br>
    <br>
    Taking from the ‘buffer.com’ article. I’ll take small wins in an area I find challenging to help 
    foster a growth mindset in myself<br>
    <br>
    <b style="color:tomato;">“Prove it to yourself in small ways and you’ll develop the confidence that you can improve.”</b></p>
