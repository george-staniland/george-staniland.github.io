    Reflecting on <i> core  </i>learning during foundations
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
  </h3>
  
  <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
  </h4>
  <p> <b> 1) </b>I need to practice being patient, and methodical. There is a lot of value in a problem solving framework for me, and the more I use it the more habitual and it easier it becomes to follow. <br>
    <br>
    <b> 2) </b> I, probably like a lot of people, am quick to criticise myself when I can’t solve a problem. But with time and patience you get through it, and can solve it. <br>
    <br>
    <b> 3) </b> My mind generates a lot of chatter and new avenues of thought while listening to someone
    </p>

  <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
  <p> Self-awareness allows us to work with our strengths and flaws, towards more effectively achieving our goals. Empathy guides us in the way we interact with others, it lets us create 
    better experiences for those we interact with and our selves. </p>
  
  <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
  <p> I thought the listening and looping exercise was really powerful! So meditative and 
    intimate to assign sometime just too listening.</p>

  <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
  <p> Trying to bring the problem solving framework and different problem solving techniques into my workflow </p>

  <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
  <p>  I guess these aspects the we have covered, empathy towards others,  awareness of our selves, conscious problem solving, are overarching tools that impact of our 
    work and personal life, and can improve the quality of both. As a school Dev Academy also has feedback that these traits are desirable in the tech industry along with technical ability. 
  </p>

  <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
  </h4>
  <p> Sometimes, a little bit. But I think it's also really valuable. It lays a foundation of wellness to build our technical skills upon. <br> It’s a bit ‘woo woo’ at times,  but I think it is: <br>
    <br>
    a) desired by the industry <br>
    <br>
    and <br>
    <br>
    b) good for you on a personal level. </p>
