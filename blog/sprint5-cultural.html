    Reflecting on <i> core </i>learning during foundations
    <br>
    <br>

  </h3>

  <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
  </h4>
  <p> <b> 1) </b>I need to practice being patient, and methodical. There is a lot of value in a problem solving
    framework for me, and the more I use it the more habitual and it easier it becomes to follow. <br>
    <br>
    <b> 2) </b> I, probably like a lot of people, am quick to criticise myself when I can’t solve a problem. But with
    time and patience you get through it, and can solve it. <br>
    <br>
    <b> 3) </b> My mind generates a lot of chatter and new avenues of thought while listening to someone
  </p>

  <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
  <p> Self-awareness allows us to work with our strengths and flaws, towards more effectively achieving our goals.
    Empathy guides us in the way we interact with others, it lets us create
    better experiences for those we interact with and our selves. </p>

  <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
  <p> I thought the listening and looping exercise was really powerful! So meditative and
    intimate to assign sometime just too listening.</p>

  <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
  <p> Trying to bring the problem solving framework and different problem solving techniques into my workflow </p>

  <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
    development bootcamp course?</h4>
  <p> I guess these aspects the we have covered, empathy towards others, awareness of our selves, conscious problem
    solving, are overarching tools that impact of our
    work and personal life, and can improve the quality of both. As a school Dev Academy also has feedback that these
    traits are desirable in the tech industry along with technical ability.
  </p>

  <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time
    to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
  </h4>
  <p> Sometimes, a little bit. But I think it's also really valuable. It lays a foundation of wellness to build our
    technical skills upon. <br> It’s a bit ‘woo woo’ at times, but I think it is: <br>
    <br>
    a) desired by the industry <br>
    <br>
    and <br>
    <br>
    b) good for you on a personal level. </p>

  <h4> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </h4>
  <p> I primarily want to use the skills from this course to gain a cognitively challenging & interesting job that supports me financially. I also think there will be a lot of companies with interesting mission statements that require programmers to actualise their vision, I would love to be a part of that.<br>
    <br> I will stay in Wellington initially, I think New Zealand is going to be a really strong country for tech-based jobs after and during the Covid-19 Pandemic. After a year or two I would like to travel abroad I think </p>

  <h4> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? </h4>
  <p> Considering my strengths and limitations at present: 
    One limitation I am proud of working with more effectively is "my susceptibility to being thrown off by a bad mood or a bad nights sleep” - To combat this I have set up routines and attempted to ‘just show up’ for them. Get my self to a certain spot and the time I say I will and give it a crack, its worked well the last four weeks. <br>
    <br>
    Going into Bootcamp, I think a limitation will be my ability to focus in a busy, social environment. A strength will be, hopefully, and somewhat contradictorily, the boost you get from a social environment. The energy of a group of use embarking on this difficult task.
    </p>

  <h4> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
  </h4>
  <p> A non-technical task I will struggle with will be staying on top of the material, I think I have been quite fortunate with my 'time freedom' in the last couple of years. Going to the gym, long walks, partying on the weekends, having work-free weekends, knocking off at 5pm on a weekday and watching Netflix - and I think Dev Academy will require more than that as we are attempting to learn a lot in short space of time. I will have to adapt to that and be ready to give up some Netflix time.  </p>

  <h4> What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA? </h4>
  <p> I would love to cultivate more of a sense of purpose. I have often been poor at working towards long term goals or having long term dreams. I think through weekly / monthly reflection, and through increased personal reflection, I can work towards a clearer understanding of my goals and how to work towards them. </p>

  <h4> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
  </h4>
  <p> I’ll seek help from the facilitator and/or the human facilitator person in Wellington, I can’t remember her name (sorry!) <br>
    <br>

    Once Bootcamp has started I'll write down and test some new routines, I'll figure out what works from these. I’ll log my time and make a commitment to how many hours I put in. I’ll push myself but Ill also make sure, I have rest time, and take care of my mental and physical health.  </p>
