  <p> <b>• Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</b><br>
<br>
I was working for a scaffolding company in February of this year. We spent a fair amount of time driving around in the work trucks, around town, down Lambton Quay. The guys love driving down Lambton Quay so
 they can check out the ladies, It’s unashamed cat calling type stuff, except they don’t actually yell anything. So that whole situation is kind of gross in the first place. So I’m driving down Lambton Quay with a workmate, we see a tall, 
 pretty beautiful lady, who looks like she’s of Samoan descent. My workmate yells out, “Out shit I used to go to school with that person, they used to be dude!” - I acknowledge what he said but I’m not really engaging at the point, he 
 continues “Shit if I bumped into them I would even talk to them aye, I’d just pretend like I didn’t know them, fucking weird ” <br>
 <br>
It hits me in kind of a sad way, I like this guy, we get along, I think we have more of a shared world view that I do with some of my other co-workers but then he comes out with this really insensitive, transphobic stuff. I weigh it 
up, I could say something, say that they are just a person, this is there life experience, high-school must have been really hard for them - but I don’t want the ‘record to skip’, I don’t want to cause a commotion, and have him feeling 
negative emotions towards me. <br>
<br>
So I say nothing. We finish the day. The consequences are there are no new opinions in his brain about being open to people different to himself in this way, and I kept from rocking the boat, I don’t assert my inner views on 
the outer world.<br>
<br>
    •    <b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</b><br>
    <br>
I think a western New Zealand culture makes you quite self-focused, there’s a lot of emphasis on self-improvement and self-optimisation. 
Within the culture of my family, I think there is a lot of love, acceptance, a reasonable level of open-mindedness, we eat healthy, lots of vegetables. My family has instilled values of service to others, kindness, generosity, empathy. <br>
<br>

Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.<br>
<br>
•   <b> Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development </b> <br>
    <br>
My strengths are: Excitement to have a purpose, to be lead, to have structure, and my drive to be empowered to do all those things for myself.  I have good interpersonal skills, my mum and dad are both very social.  My 
limitations include: I can withdraw from the social world if I feel in a depressive state, I can ruminate obsessively - I have anxiety.  I struggle to find my own opinions and goals as enough impetus to actualise something in the world <br>
<br>
•  <b> Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</b><br>
    <br>
I think I will thrive on the structure of this course, hopefully, this will intersect with my need for permission to do things. <br>

<br>
    <b>•    Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections 
    on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</b><br>
    <br>

Trying to barbecue some lamb chops with my dad.  I was hostile and immediately felt he was patronising me with his advice. I tried to know that what he is saying is coming from a good place.
