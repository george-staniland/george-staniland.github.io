  Problem Solving Techniques
  </h3>

  <h4> Getting blocked on a simple problem </h4>
  <p>  A simple problem I got stuck on was taking a sentence and capitalising the first letter of every word. When you say this problem out
  loud it seems quite simple - but getting a fucntion to do it, as a learning developer, provided some challenges. <br>
  <br>
  For this problem I had to learn about a built in 'application' in Javascript - we call them methods.  This method could search through a bunch of words and perform an action on each word, exactly what I needed to do this challenge! So I was learning about this method and I couldn't seem to get it to work, it was the first step in the solving the problem and I felt like I was already failing. I thought the problem was that I was initalsing the 'method' in the wrong way, but It turns out I needed to convert the information I was feeding into the method, and that most of my code was ok. <br>
  <br>
  It was like I was trying to jam a cassette tape in a CD player. It was never going to work.<br>
  <br>
  The thing is I knew the information I was 'giving' to the method was wrong but I was to flussterd about it not working to realise this was the problem. In the end I asked my tutor about the issue, he pointed out that the input was the wrong 'format' and that sent me on my way to solving the problem. <br>
  <br>
  I felt overwhelmed by this problem, instead of focusing on the immediate 'slice' of the problem in front of me, I kept 'zooming' out and getting overwhelmed by thinking about the problem in it entirety. <br>
  <br>
  <h4> Solving a problem in an elegant way</h4>
  <p> This was a small stepping stone on the way to solving a larger problem, but I was proud of how I solved it.  I had a bunch of test scores belong to a student. This was inside a javascript document, and the scores and the name of the student were in different places. Instead of typing out the scores in the new place, I simply referenced or created a little window beside the students name showing where the tests score were.<br>
  <br>
  To solve this problem I just tried something.<br>
  <br>
  Through this challenge I learnt that almost everything in a javascript file can be linked to another, we can draw a little thread from one keyword to a another so that now it references it, like a detective solving a murder on a corkboard.

 <h3> Reflecting on some problem solving techniques and processes: </h3>

<h4 >Pseudocode    </h4>
<h4 style="color: lightsalmon"> 3 out of 5 </h4>
<p> Pseudocode was starting to become helpful, as I gained a bit more knowledge and confidence with Javascript.      </p>
<br>

<h4> Trying something   </h4>
<h4 style="color: lightsalmon"> 3 out of 5 </h4>
<p>  The old go to, just give it a try. This can be helpful, but often I just keep jumping with 'trying it',
  and it starts to be become unproductive    </p>
<br>

<h4> Rubber ducky method   </h4>
<h4 style="color: lightsalmon"> 2 out of 5 </h4>
<p> I tried this a few times but maybe not enough, I should try slow down and explain the problem out loud.    </p>
<br>

<h4> Reading error messages   </h4>
<h4 style="color: lightsalmon"> 3 out of 5 </h4>
<p>  Somewhat helpful, again this will get more helpful as I become familar with Javascript and coding in general</p>
<br>

<h4>  Console.logging  </h4>
<h4 style="color: lightsalmon"> 4 out of 5 </h4>
<p>  Very helpful. Its nice to see what is happening in this strange black box    </p>
<br>

<h4> Googling   </h4>
<h4 style="color: lightsalmon"> 4 out of 5 </h4>
<p> Everything is out there. But It can also be a massive rabbit hole.      </p>
<br>

<h4>Asking your peers for help   </h4>
<h4 style="color: lightsalmon"> 3 out of 5 </h4>
<p> I need to reach out more and try this more !    </p>
<br>

<h4> Asking coaches for help    </h4>
<h4 style="color: lightsalmon"> 4 out of 5 </h4>
<p>  Very helpful!     </p>
<br>

<h4>  Improving your process with reflection  </h4>
<h4 style="color: lightsalmon"> 4 out of 5 </h4>
<p> Yeah I think this is a really powerful to, I need to continue incorporating it into my routine     </p>
