    •	What is your long term goal and or career pathway? <br>
    <br>
    I would love to be employed at a medium to large company, working as a junior developer. I don’t even know exactly what ‘junior developer’ involves, but I was drawn to the idea of being a developer after reading it involved working “in teams, 
    with people and problem-solving’ . <br>
    <br>
      •	What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?<br>
    <br>
    Learning to tackle problems ‘like a developer’ I think could be powerful in many aspects of my life. Learning to approach problems systematically, calmly, planning, taking time - training myself neurologically to think more like this 
    would be a healthier and more efficient way for my mind to function. <br>
    <br>
      •	A description of your own strengths and limitations<br>
       <br>
    My Strengths are my moderately good work ethic, if I say I am going to do 6 hours of ‘deep work’ in a day, Ill normally do about 5. There is room for improvement here. I have high expectations of my self, I think this drives me. I can remove myself from the external world fairly easily. <br>
     <br>
    My Limitations is my susceptibility to being thrown off by a bad mood, or a bad nights sleep, I often put work of by an hour or two because I don’t feel in an ‘optimal state’. I can get upset when I cannot work around a problem, throwing away my problem-solving framework and 
    just ‘banging my head’ against it which often just makes it worse. <br>
     <br>
      •	Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. <br> This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.<br>
       <br>
    I think in terms of being thrown off by a bad mood or not sleeping well or whatever, I should approach it by ‘just showing up’, I think there is a Woody Allen quote about that. Anyway, I can just get to my desk, or wherever I need to be and give it my best. It terms of working with 
    others, I think it would be good to feel that sometimes other people struggled to ‘just show up’ as well, be aware of others struggle as, and just let that be a variable in my mind. <br>
    <br>
    Yeah, so design a routine, refine it, and then try to just show up for it when you said you would. Take breaks if I need. Be consistent. I often work better by myself, In my own quiet little space, which might be challenging during Bootcamp, I’ll try to still carve out time to 
    work solo during Bootcamp, but embrace the peer-coding exercise, and maybe just talk to my partner if I am finding the group work overwhelming.  <br>
     <br>
      •	A commitment as to how and where you will seek <br> help in a timely way.<br>
       <br>
    I’ll talk to my whanau, I mean I already complain to them, but they are helpful. Also making sure to check in with my facilitator, and writing down questions during the week as I think of them.<br>
     <br>
      •	A description of what you expect from the facilitation team<br>
       <br>
    I expect supportive and proactive weekly check-ins during foundations. Not to sound bossy, haha. <br>
     <br>
      •	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.<br>
       <br>
    Nope no really. I am lucky in this sense. I just have to remember to cook family dinner when it’s my turn!
