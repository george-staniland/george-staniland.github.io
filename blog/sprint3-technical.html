   Bringing Javascript, Html and Css Together!
  </h3>

  <h4> What is Html and Css, and how do they work together</h4>
  <p> 
  Html provides the structure of a web page. It's like laying out a bunch of plastic box's on your living room
  floor, that you intend to organise your ..... stuffed toy collection into .. or whatever. You layout each box and give them a name, and then chuck your
  content in there. Each box is pale grey and boring.<br>
  <br>
  CSS comes along (this is where the analogy gets shaky) and magically changes the colour of the boxes to whatever we want, and 
  can also change there size and a whole array of other properties. <br>
  <br>
  In summary Html sets the 'boxs' of a website and the content inside them, Css lets us colour to them and borders, and anything else visual!

  <h4> Control Flow and Loops </h4>
<p>
Control flow is the order in which our code is 'read' and initialised. A loop is essentially something that will 
continue to repeat until a until certain condition is meet. With our <i> for </i>, <i> while  </i> and <i> do..while</i> loops
they will continue to run some code until an expression we specify returns false. <br>
<br>
Control flow is like the order you read the page of a book in, and you 'loop' until you understand what the a sentence means - or until the statement 'george dosent know what 
unkempt means' returns false.
</p>


<h4> The Dom </h4>
<p> This stands for The Document Object model. The DOM represents an Html file as a tree of objects. Its shows the nodes 
of html file in a hierarchical fashion and allows them to be manipluated by a Javascript file, for instance. 
</p>

<h4> Objects and Arrays, and accessing the goodies within them  </h4>
<p>

These are both data types in Javascript.<br>
They hold multiple points of data. With an array we access its data points by index, starting at 0,
each item that is chucked in the 'array bag' has a number (index) and its starts at 0 from the first item that 
goes in. Objects are slighly more organised, they hold multiple data points that are labeld with <i> properties</i>
and these label's can be used to access whatever the object holds. 

<h4> What are functions, and why are these useful?  </h4>
<p>
A function is basically a reusable chunk of code that does something. The "something" it does 
could be defined by you, defined by some 3rd party library you are using, or it 
could be defined by the JavaScript framework itself.
