  <b> What is Emotional Intelligence? </b> <br>
    <br>
    'Emotional Intelligence is the capability of individuals to recognise their own emotions and those of others' and to use this understanding 
    to guide their thinking and actions. <br>
    <br>
    Daniel Goldman who did some of the earliest writing on emotional intelligence breaks EQ down into 
    five categories. <br>
    <br>
    <mark><b>Self-awareness</b></mark><br>
    The ability to understand your effect on others, play to your strengths, and admit your weaknesses<br>
    <br>
    <mark><b>Self-Management</b></mark><br>
    Being able to control your impulses and avoid acting rashly<br> 
    <br>
    <mark><b>Motivation</b></mark><br>
    Having the innate passion to challenge yourself and remain optimistic when the going gets tough<br>
    <br>
    <mark><b>Empathy</b></mark><br>
    Not just listening to those around you, but really trying to understand their point of view. <br>
    <br>
    <mark><b>Social Communication</b></mark><br>
    The ability to manage relationships and productively express your emotions.  <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b> How is Emotional Intelligence different from IQ? </b> <br>
    <br>
    Let's start by defining IQ: <br> IQ or Intelligence Quotient is a composite score made up of the results of many different tests of 
    reasoning, memory, acquired knowledge and mental processing speed. IQ tests are designed to measure your general ability to solve 
    problems and understand concepts. <br>
    <br>
    In my view, Emotional Intelligence would be more learned than physiological, and genetic. It has to do with attunement to emotion, 
    our own and others and is less concrete both to teach and to measure.  <br>
    <br>
    <br>
   <b> Why is it Important? </b> <br>
    <br>
    We are highly social animals, having positive social interactions in work could help us achieve our career goals more effectively. 
    Furthermore, having healthy relationships, personally and at work makes us happier. A positive outlook is a catalyst for many other 
    helpful changes in our life.
