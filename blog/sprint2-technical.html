    Html elements are like unique video game characters within an Html document. Each element has unique attributes and abilities.  

Html elements have attributes that are set by default. 

  </p>

  <p>
If you know any Html you will know some of these elements. I donâ€™t know much HTML myself, but here we go:  <br>
<br>
We have &lt;div&gt; tags, we have our heading tags &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, paragraph tags &lt;p&gt;, &lt;span&gt; tags and &lt;img&gt; tags. 

We call each element when we need to format our content. The &lt;H1&gt; tags make some text bolder, &lt;img&gt; lets us add an image. &lt;div&gt; tags 
create a container taking up the full width of screen, &lt;span&gt; tags create 
containers that take up only as much space as they need.

Each tag has inherent attributes. Like video game characters some are loud and powerful, like &lt;div&gt; tags, taking up the full width on the page, 
some are more peaceful like &lt;span&gt; tags, that will sit side by side. 
</p>

<p>
But we can specify and change some of these inherent properties. One of them is the *display* property. By default, this attribute is set to block or inline. 

display: block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available (they stretch out to the left and right as far as they can).

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

Note: We can set the width and height of display: block elements but not of display: inline elements
</p>

<p>
<b>These elements are have the display property block by default:</b> <br>
<br>
&lt;div&gt; 
<br>
&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; 
<br>
&lt;p&gt; 
<br>
&lt;form&gt; 
<br>
&lt;header&gt; 
<br>
&lt;section&gt; 
</p> 

<p>
These ones are inline by default: <br>
<br>
&lt;span&gt; 
<br>
&lt;a&gt; 
<br>
&lt;img&gt; 
</p>

<p>
We can change the attributes of these elements when we want, we can change a &lt;div&gt; element to display: inline or span element to display: block.

There is also a third option where we change the display property to display: inline-block
</p>

<p>
Ultimately this post was supposed to be about <i> display: inline </i> and <i>display:inline-block </i> -
basically, display: inline is helpful as it lets elements sit horizontally next to each other, but with this attribute, we cannot set the width and height. Display: inline-block - lets elements sit next to each other and lets us set the width and 
height properties. Its the best of both worlds.
